Cmu Bus is a simpe (and published) Alexa skill that says when is the next CMU A/AB shuttle leaving from the Morewood station.

*Invocation name*: "CMU bus" (protip: be loud in pronouncing the s)

*Response*: it will tell the second closest and the closest time the A and AB shuttles are leaving

*Features and known issues*: it correctly handles the weekend and weekday schedule. Does not recognize weekday holidays (when the shuttles run the weekend schedule). Curretly uses the hardcoded schedule from the CMU website, i.e., it does not look for any online changes in the schedule.

Feel free to issue a pull request if you want to contribute to the code.
